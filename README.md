# ec530finalproj

Final project for BU EC530 course. This is a smart pdf reader. It takes a pdf file as input and can translate the file to another language. It can also read the pdf out loud as an audio book for users that have trouble reading and would rather listen. Finally, it combines these two features and can read translated pdf documents out loud. It uses the googletrans api to translate the text. 

To run: 

pip install -r requirements.txt 

python app.py 

Thank you!
